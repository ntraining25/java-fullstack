## How to Make the Most of This Program:

*   **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate 2 hours every day. Even short, consistent practice is more effective than sporadic long sessions.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just watch or read. Write code, debug, experiment, and break things!
*   **Ask Questions:** If something isn't clear, ask your instructor or search for answers. Understanding the 'why' is as important as the 'how'.
*   **Build a Project:** Apply what you learn by building a single, evolving project throughout the 45 days. This will solidify your understanding and give you something tangible to showcase.
*   **Utilize Resources:** The provided resources are a starting point. Explore, read documentation, and watch other tutorials.
*   **Practice Problem Solving:** Regularly attempt coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode.

*   **Concept Quizzes:** Quick checks on theoretical understanding.
*   **Code Review:** Instructor review of daily practical exercises.

### Weekly Milestones
*   **End of Week 1 (Day 7):** Basic Java programming quiz and a small coding assignment.
*   **End of Week 2 (Day 14):** OOP and advanced Java concepts assessment.
